DayOneCarousel
========

A script for finding [Day One](http://dayoneapp.com) entries that don't yet have a photo attached, but a photo was taken on the day of the entry and could be attached to it. The script obtains photos from the Camera Uploads folder used by Dropbox's [Carousel](https://carousel.dropbox.com).

Designed to be used with OSX, however the paths can be adapted to work with other platforms.
